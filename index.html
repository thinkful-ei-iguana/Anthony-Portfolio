        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="about-writeup">
          I started learning web development in early 2018, after going to
          school and practicing in my free time. After building static websites
          for a year, I decided to take my interest to the next level and join a
          coding bootcamp to learn more and learn how to work as a team with
          other developers. Now a little bit me as a person outside of
          developing. I was born in Indiana but lived most of my life in Florida
          then moved to Washington in 2019. Therefore I am a big fan of the
          Colts & Seahawks. I also love playing video games mostly first person
          shooters because I grew up on great games like Halo and Call of Duty.
          I also spend alot of my time on Medium reading up on the latest
          framework updates. And so ya I hope you have a grasp about who I am.

          <p class="projectL-writeup">
            For this app I worked with another member of my cohort and our goal
            was to build a quiz app that used DOM manipulation to change what
            the users saw. We used vanilla JS and jQuery to manipulate the dom
            and styled the app with css. The app also is a11y friendly so screen
            readers work properly and the user can fulling complete the quiz
            with keyboard.

          <p class="projectR-writeup">
            The bookmark app was my first solo project I completed. The app
            allows users to store their favorite websites. For each bookmark the
            user can give it a Name, Rating, Description, and a link. I used
            vanilla JS and jQuery to manipulate the DOM. I used a private API to
            make the users bookmarks persistent after refresh.

          <p class="projectL-writeup">
            For this project I also worked with another member of my cohort. The
            purpose of this app is to let users input one or more US state(s).
            Then when the user submits their form it sends a API call to a
            public park API. The API call returns a list of parks with their
            location and descriptions in the state(s) the user inputed. The user
            can also choose how many parks they want returned.
